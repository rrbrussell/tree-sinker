# Tree-Sinker

This is a small program that I am using to manage compressed readonly
copies of the Gentoo Portage tree and the various overalys that I use.
I am opening this program up under the terms of the GPL-2.0 only
license so other people can use it.

## Current status.

[*] I can make a Python Wheel out of the package.
[*] Default Systemd timers, mounts, and service files are provided.
[ ] Correctly setup an installer for those files.
[ ] Download a squashfs.
[ ] Read a configuration file properly.
[ ] Tests.
